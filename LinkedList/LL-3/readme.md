Q.5 Program to print n’th node from the end of a Linked List
  Given a Linked List and a number n, write a function that returns the value at the n’th node from the end of 
  the Linked List.
  For example
  Input : A->B->C->D index = 3
  Output : B
  Explanation: third index from last is B so print B

  Input : 1->2->3->4->5 index = 2
  Output : 4

  Input: 1->2->3->4->5 index = 6
  Output : NULL
